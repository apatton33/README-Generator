# README-Generator

## Description
    I was tasked through the acceptance criteria to build a README Generator. I cloned 
    starter code and then followed some comments within the code to write questions and 
    have a user able to answer question with a goal of creating a README. The README 
    needed to follow professional README Guidelines. I then had to make a video of me
    acting as a user and going through the Generator useing node just like the user
    would do if they were generating one. The link to the video is 
    https://drive.google.com/file/d/1D92Ma6b9l7U4L9brPqyX9LqaI5QwaoaN/view.


## Usage

## License
